# Offshore-Mate Local Storage Implementation PRD

## Project Overview
Offshore-Mate is a rotation schedule management application for offshore workers. Currently, users need to create an account to save their rotation schedules. This feature enhancement will implement browser local storage functionality to allow users to save and return to their schedules without creating an account.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. Save rotation schedules to the browser's local storage when created or modified
2. Automatically load saved schedules when a user returns to the application
3. Allow users to manage multiple saved schedules (create, view, edit, delete)
4. Provide clear UI indicators for locally saved schedules
5. Include an option to clear locally saved data

### User Experience
1. When a user creates a new schedule, automatically save it to local storage
2. Display a notification confirming that the schedule has been saved locally
3. When a user returns to the application, show a list of previously saved schedules
4. Allow users to select a saved schedule to load and edit
5. Provide a clear option to delete saved schedules
6. Include a "save" button to manually trigger saving to local storage

### Technical Requirements
1. Use browser's localStorage API to store schedule data
2. Implement proper error handling for storage limits and browser compatibility
3. Store schedules as JSON objects with appropriate metadata (creation date, last modified date, schedule name)
4. Implement versioning to handle potential future data structure changes
5. Provide a migration path for users who later want to create an account and persist their schedules to the server

### Performance and Security
1. Limit the total size of locally stored data to prevent performance issues
2. Do not store any sensitive personal information in local storage
3. Implement data validation when retrieving from local storage
4. Clear indication to users about the limitations of local storage (browser-specific, cleared when browser data is cleared)

## Success Metrics
1. Increased user retention (users returning to the application)
2. Reduced friction for new users exploring the application
3. Increased schedule creation by users without accounts

## Timeline
Priority: High
Suggested implementation time: 1 week
