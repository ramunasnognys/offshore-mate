# Product Requirements Document: PDF Export Feature

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the requirements for implementing PDF export functionality in the OffshoreMate application. The feature will complement the existing PNG export capability, providing users with professional document format options for sharing and archiving their work rotation schedules.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

### Current State
OffshoreMate currently supports only PNG image export for work rotation calendars. While PNG is suitable for digital sharing and viewing, it has limitations for professional documentation and archival purposes.

### Problem Analysis
- **Professional Sharing**: Employers and HR departments often require PDF documents for official records and compliance
- **Print Quality**: PNG images may not provide optimal print quality for physical documentation
- **Document Management**: Corporate document management systems typically prefer PDF format for indexing and storage
- **Accessibility**: PDF format supports better accessibility features and text searchability
- **File Size**: For large calendars, PDF can be more efficient than high-resolution PNG images

### Business Impact
- **User Friction**: Workers must use external tools to convert PNG to PDF for professional sharing
- **Adoption Barrier**: Some organizations may not adopt the tool due to lack of PDF export
- **User Experience**: Inconsistent with professional workflow expectations
